# Python Data Science Workshop
Notebooks and code for the Spring 2019 Python Data Science Workshop at CU Boulder.

## Courses
I am currently developing neural networks for the following short courses:

### Python Data Wrangling
This course teaches some of the building blocks for handling data in Python. We will show how to parse and manipulate data using Numpy and Pandas, and perform visualization with Matplotlib. We analyze a real dataset using Scipy, demonstrating how to perform linear regression, confidence interval computation, and other basic statistical tasks.

### Intro to Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-learn
This course introduces the Scikit-learn library for doing machine learning in Python. We start with simple linear regression, and gradually look at other machine learning methods such as PCA, k-means clustering, and random decision forests. Throughout this session, students will learn how to use Scikit-learn to create their own machine learning pipeline for real-world problems.

### Building Neural Networks with Keras
Neural networks are becoming an increasingly important tool in machine learning. In this short course, we demonstrate how to rapidly prototype an artificial neural network (ANN) in Python using the Keras library. We briefly introduce ANNs, including important variations like convolutional networks. Using Keras, students will build their own networks for some basic natural language processing and computer vision tasks.
